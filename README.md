# Usher Ministry Management System (UMMS)

A mobile-first web application designed to manage church ushering ministry operations,
including event scheduling, usher registration, role-based access, and administrative dashboards.

## Problem
The ministry previously relied on Google Forms, Google Sheets, and AppSheet, resulting in
fragmented data, manual workarounds, and limited access control.

## Solution
UMMS centralizes data and workflows into a single system with:
- Role-based authentication
- Event and service management
- Usher registration and assignment
- Mobile-first UI
- Clean API-driven architecture

## Project Status
🚧 Phase 1 – MVP Development

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Auth: Google OAuth
- Frontend: Web / PWA
