# Project Proposal – UMMS

## Background
The ushering ministry currently uses multiple disconnected tools:
- Google Forms
- Google Sheets
- AppSheet
- Custom Apps Scripts

This results in duplicated logic, manual processes, and limited scalability.

## Objectives
- Centralize ministry data
- Replace Google Forms and AppSheet
- Introduce role-based access
- Support mobile-first usage
- Prepare for push notifications

## Scope (Phase 1 – MVP)
- Web-based application
- Google OAuth authentication
- Centralized database
- Event and usher management
- Admin dashboard

## Out of Scope
- Native mobile apps
- Full legacy Apps Script migration
- Advanced analytics

## Success Criteria
- Core leaders can manage events and ushers
- Ushers can view assignments
- Google Forms and AppSheet are no longer required
